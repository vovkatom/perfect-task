## About

Task Pro is an application that helps you organize your work and save time. With
Task Pro, you'll never forget important tasks again.

After a quick registration and login (you can also log in using Google), you're
in: you can create your first board and enjoy the app. Manage several projects
simultaneously, create and customize as many boards as you need with an
unlimited number of columns and cards! You can prioritize cards, move them
between columns, and set due dates.

You can edit your account anytime by changing your avatar, name, or email
address. If you need help with Task Pro, you can send an email describing your
problem - the application has a feedback form located in the sidebar.

The app offers light, dark, and violet modes for a better user experience. Use
it on your smartphone, tablet, or laptop - it's excellently adapted for every
device.
